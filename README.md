# LLMs-for-the-Design-of-Sustainable-Concretes

Summary:
This repository showcases a novel approach to accelerate the discovery of sustainable concretes using large language models (LLMs) and compares it with traditional methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Random Forest (RF). The project addresses the inherent complexity and variability of building materials, which has historically limited the development of sustainable concretes due to labor-intensive laboratory testing. The use of LLMs offers advantages such as incorporating context and general knowledge into predictions, flexibility in handling non-numeric inputs, and effective integration of domain knowledge. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of LLMs to outperform traditional models by more than 40 percent, even with limited datasets. The project highlights the democratizing potential of LLMs in material science, making the development of sustainable concretes more accessible to experts and contributing to the quest for sustainability in the construction industry. Future research directions include refining LLMs for material design applications, integrating domain knowledge more effectively, and addressing other complex material design challenges.
